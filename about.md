I am a historian and digital humanist. I studied classical philology, Mediterranean culture studies and history in Poznan and Leeds, as well as British studies at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. In 2015 I was granted a doctoral fellowship by the Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies within the program Ancient Languages and Texts. My dissertation (2018) examined the he uses of the material past in Early Medieval Britain and will be published in 2020 by Amsterdam University Press. I work on the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, mapping medieval Latin manuscripts, and the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies. I am a Stanford Text Technologies Postdoctoral Fellow and Assistant Lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin.

I do workshops and public lectures on the topics of medieval history, digital humanities and Middle Ages in pop-culture. If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact me!
