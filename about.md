I am a historian and digital humanist. I am currently a postdoc at University of Lausanne, and an Assistant Lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin. Previously, I was a TextTechnologies Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. I work on the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, mapping medieval Latin manuscripts, and the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies as well as the inheritance of Rome in the post-Roman world.

Between 2015 and 2018, I did my PhD at the Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies within the program Ancient Languages and Texts. My dissertation (2018) examines the uses of the material past in Early Medieval Britain, and will be published in 2020 by Amsterdam University Press as *Roman Infrastructure in Early Medieval Britain: The Transformation of the Past in Text and Stone*. I studied classical philology, Mediterranean culture studies and history in Poznan and Leeds, as well as British studies at Humboldt University Berlin.

I do workshops and public lectures on the topics of medieval history, digital humanities, and the Middle Ages in pop culture. If you are interested, don’t hesitate to contact me!
