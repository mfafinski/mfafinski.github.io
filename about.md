I am a historian and a translator. I studied classical philology, Mediterranean culture studies and history in Poznan and Leeds as well as British studies at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. In 2015 I was granted a doctoral fellowship by the Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies within the program Ancient Languages and Texts. My dissertation examines the problem of continuity in the context of in Britain after the Roman withdrawal and the uses and re-uses of the past in Anglo-Saxon Britain.
