title: On the archaeology of Hello World pages
---

There is really, really nothing sadder than a welcome post.

Especially in academia, ridden with blogs that have template 'Hello world' posts and unfinished Word Press websites.

Therefore this post is going to be a bit of a musing over the digital presence in the so-called university world.

I've just came back from probably the biggest conference event on this side of the pond - IMC in Leeds. Apart from it being amazing (as per usual) one thing struck me pretty hard: in arts and humanities we are still in digital stone age.

We exchange business cards. We write down emails in notebooks. Yours truly is, of course, guilty as charged.

I cannot plausibly offer first, a reason and second, a solution to that problem. The obvious ones don't work anymore: age, lack of access, lack of need. Somehow, apart from the chosen few we still persist in the age of the plain text email (if even that).

That was probably the final push for me. So if you are reading this grab a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or WordPress and get on rolling. Worth, at least, a try. And worst case scenario? Yet another Hello World page!
